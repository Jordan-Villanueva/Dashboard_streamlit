The _init_.py is not of my authorship. The link to the file can be found at:

This version of the app uses as a main code (from local) the file 'Last_Choropleth.py'. I have added circle markers to indicate the Entidad Federativa and the amount of Poblacion Economicamente Activa.

For further changes, review the aforementioned code.
